## Keynote: Where do you see Python in 10 years?

Russell Keith-Magee (Beeware)

**TL;DR**: For those who care about the Python's longevity in the web-first future, check out Beeware.

* Where do you see Python in 10 years? (Subtext: what can we do today to make sure Python community stay vibrant for the next 10 years?)
* Black Swan events are: A surprise event that has major effect but is easily explained (in hindsight)
* Python's black swan:
  * Black swan 1: everyone use a laptop (which may not be true in 10 years as mobile phones and tablets surge in popularity)
  * Black swan 2: Python can stay on the server. With advent of html, many businesses are increasingly embed their business logic in the Javascript (where the code can execute on client browser).
  * Black swan 3: Installation is a solved problem (it is not)
  * Black swan 4: Code distribution doesn't matter (What happens if the users who wants to use your code doesn't have Python? Other languages has a way to package the code into something that can be executed)
* The speaker's goal is to start a conversation about ensuring long-term viability of Python
* BeeWare project: run in Python and deploy anywhere.
* Lesson 1: It's not enough to just follow the rules. You have to ensure the competition is fair.
* Lesson 2: Watch out for black swans!
  * WASM would allow non-Javascript language to execute on javascript runtime (client side?)
* Lesson 3: team support
  * More than just software engineering
  * Product management, team management, PSF, legal...
* Lesson 4: Money make things happen.
  * Expertise costs money. (Metaphor for OSS)
  * Money get things done. (Relying on volunteer OSS maintainers is not sustainable)
  * PyPI MOSS grant - got the stuff done in 7 month.
  * R&D matters!
  * Problem: how do we pay for this? OSS is a engineering models, not a business model.
* Burnout: dealing with people has a lot of emotional cost.
  * The hidden human cost of FLOSS can not be ignored.
* Five calls to action:
  * Start thinking about black swans
  * Improve resourcing of maintenance and R&D efforts
  * Value contributors and their contributions
  * Get out your wallets! psf donations, numfocus.org, djangoproject.com
  * Contribute!
